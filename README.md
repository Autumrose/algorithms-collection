# Algorithm Projects Repository
Welcome to the Algorithm Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of algorithm-based programming challenges and solutions. Each project represents a unique problem and its implementation in Java. Below is a description of each project included in the repository.

## Projects Overview
### 1. Rainbow
#### Description:
A solution to the "Under the Rainbow" problem. The program calculates the minimum penalty for planning a hotel trip given a set of distances between hotels. The penalty is based on the deviation from the ideal daily travel distance of 400 miles.

#### Features:

* Input: Number of hotels and distances between them.
* Output: The minimum penalty.
#### Execution:
Run the underTheRainbow class to input the data and calculate the optimal penalty.

### 2. Cartesian Prime
#### Description:
Captain Kirk must escape from Cartesia Prime using a site-to-site Cartesian transporter. This program determines whether Kirk can reach the coordinate (0,0) without encountering Borg drones and within a given time limit.

#### Features:

* Input: Kirk's initial position, transporter constants, Borg cube arrival time, and the positions of Borg drones.
* Output: Success message with remaining time or failure message.
#### Execution:
Run the cartesianprime class to input the scenario details and check if Kirk can escape.

### 3. Fireworks
#### Description:
Simulates the placement of launchers for a fireworks display to maximize the smallest distance between adjacent launchers. The program calculates the optimal arrangement of launchers for different firing scenarios.

#### Features:

* Input: Number of launchers, distances between them, and scenarios specifying the number of shells to fire.
* Output: Optimal smallest separation for each scenario.
#### Execution:
Run the fireworks class to input launcher data and determine the optimal placement for each scenario.

### 4. Grid Gobble
#### Description:
A grid-based game where players aim to maximize their score by selecting numbers from a grid, following specific rules about movement between rows.

#### Features:

* Input: Grid dimensions and values for each cell.
* Output: Maximum possible score.
#### Execution:
Run the gridGobble class to input the grid and calculate the maximum achievable score.

### 5. Narrow Art Gallery
#### Description:
A problem-solving challenge involving the selection of rooms in an art gallery to maximize value while following constraints on which rooms can be selected.

#### Features:

* Input: Art gallery layout and constraints.
* Output: Maximum value achievable under the constraints.
#### Execution:
Run the narrowArtGallery class to input the gallery data and determine the optimal value.
